                        <h3>Welcome To Our FYP Junction Website </h3>
                        <p class="col-md-12">The idea of making FYP Junction was presented by our team lead after observing 3 years in
                            university
                            he came to the conclusion that there is no platform for the students of final year where they can sell
                            their 
                            projects or they can get the investment for their projects many students had brilliant ideas but they could
                            not
                            completed their FYP's due to lack of investment or financial problems so after experiencing all these thing
                            we decided to make a platform where students can get the investment for their projects and investors can get
                            the 
                            right place to invest their money
